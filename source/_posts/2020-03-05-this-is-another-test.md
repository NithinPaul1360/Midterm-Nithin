Ai opted to used bikes and not any other object because bicycles were important to him and his community as he was growing up. As a matter of fact, bicycles are still commonly used in China today for transportation so Ai used them because he thought that the audience would relate to them. The use of the forever bikes as a medium had an element of poignancy: that although bikes symbolized freedom and movement in China, the fact that they were stuck together in the piece could point to the status of the Chinese society today.
